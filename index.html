			<p>
			I am a Computer Science Graduate since 2018 June. Through different experiences and encounters in my degree, I have developed a strong interest in front-end and mobile development. Most of my work experience is in the Retail Tech Industry. I worked at 3 different telecommunications companies, and I currently work for Apple Retail as a Specialist. When I am not at work, I like to participate in different sports, such as badminton and volleyball, and work on side projects; mostly in mobile development.

			<p>
			I started my degree at the University of Calgary in September 2012. As I mentioned above, I majored in Computer Science. After years of practicing and studying, I have built a strong foundation in software development. Throughout my time at the University, I have created and participated in multiple projects. Projects involve programming, applying design principles, cooperating with team members and communicating with clients. In my final year, I was working on a project “MyBX” with a small group of people. During the project, we have to gather requirements from our client, design and create prototypes and have people review our prototypes. And then implement the UI using swift based on our final prototype.
