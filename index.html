			I am a Computer Science Graduate since 2018 June. Throughout my time at the University of Calgary, I have developed a strong interest in front-end and mobile development. My greatest inspiration was found in CPSC 599 during my final year. In CPSC 599, me and my team had to extend an existing project in iOS, from that, I got a grasp of software development process in practice. During the project, we used the "Waterfall Model" as our development process model. My biggest takeaway from this project is that I learnt how to implement User Interface programmatically and I get to apply UI design principles learnt from other courses.
			<br><br>
			Most of my work experience is in the Retail Tech Industry. I worked at 3 different telecommunications companies, and I currently work for Apple Retail as a Specialist. Through these work environments, I had developed exceptional interpersonal skill, sense of teamwork and technical aptitude. From working at Apple Retail, I learnt that behaviour drives result. Customer service is about taking the time to understand our customers; aligning their interests to their needs is what drives the business to success. These experiences allowed me exceed expectations consistently and became a top performer.
			<br><br>
			Outside of work, I like to participate in different sports, such as badminton and volleyball, and work on side projects; mostly in mobile development.
